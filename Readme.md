2. Split() Method
3. Scanner Class
4. Pattern and Matcher


Exp1: Write a program that parses given string using string tokenizer class and list all the tokens (delimeter is white space).

Exp2: Write a program that parses a given string using split method of the string class (delimeter is underscore).

Exp3: Write a program that parses a given string using Scammer class and identifies the number of different primitive datatypes in the given string like int, double, etc and lists these seperately(delimeter is white space).

Exp4: Write a program to take input from the console using scanner class. Subsequentlly prompt the user to enter his name, roll no and cgpa and store these values in string, int and double respectively.

Exp5: Parse the content of a file(.txt) using string tokenizer class (delimeter is white space).

Exp6: Parse the content of a file(.txt) using Scanner class and identifies the number of different primitive datatypes in the given string like int, double, etc and lists these seperately(delimeter is white space).

Exp7: A file urls.txt has a list of various web urls (seperated by white space). Identify the number of these urls. For each URL, identify query string. Also find various parameters (fields) in the query string. Implement this program using string tokenizer.

Exp8: A file urls.txt has a list of various web urls (seperated by white space). Identify the number of these urls. For each URL, identify query string. Also find various parameters (fields) in the query string. Implement this program using string split method.

Exp9: Write a program that asks the user to input a regular expression and a test string and reports all the substrings of the test string matching the given regular expression along with indices of the substring.

Exp10: Write a program that asks the user to input a regular expression and a test string and replaces all the substrings of the test string matching the given regular expression.

Exp11: Write a program for TCP implementation of a simple echo client-server pair
